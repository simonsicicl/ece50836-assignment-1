# 📘 Assignment 1: Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
- Apply **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions for visualization.
- **Do not use built-in PCA functions** — you must implement PCA manually.

---

## 📂 Provided Datasets
Three datasets are provided:
- `Iris`
- `Cho`
- `Iyer`

> The last column in each dataset is the cluster label; all other columns are features.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Implementation Requirements
Use the provided Python template to complete the following functions:

### 1. `loadDataSet`
- Read the CSV file
- Output `dataMat` (data matrix) and `labelMat` (labels)

### 2. `pca`
- Implement PCA to reduce data to 2 dimensions

### 3. `plot`
- Generate a scatter plot
- Color points based on labels
- Save the plot as an image file

### 4. `main`
- Call the above functions
- Support both command-line and IDE execution

---

## 📊 Assignment Steps
1. Complete the template code
2. Run PCA on the `Iris` dataset and generate a scatter plot; compare with the sample plot
3. If successful, repeat the process for `Cho` and `Iyer` datasets
4. Prepare submission materials

---

## 📦 Submission Package
Submit as a single `Assignment1.zip` file containing:

- Python source code
- Report (`Assignment1.docx` or `Assignment1.pdf`) including:
  1. Scatter plots for `Cho` and `Iyer` datasets (with axis ticks and labels)
  2. PCA and plotting code
  3. Declaration of AI tool usage (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)
